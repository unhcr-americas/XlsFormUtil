The goal of {XlsFormUtil} is to bring additional capacities when
designing XlsForm questionnaires.

Currently this includes:

- Estimate questionnaire duration

- Output a pretty print version from a maste version in xlsform

- Perform a systematic comparison between an initial questionnaire
  (master) and a customized and contextualised version. This allow to
  ensure that all key variables required for indicator calculation are
  correctly included.

The packages is also available as a shinyApp @
<https://rstudio.unhcr.org/XlsFormUtil/>

Two other R package / projects

and [ODK2Doc](https://github.com/zaeendesouza/ODK2Doc) were built with
the same goal but with a limited scope and styling capacity. Last
